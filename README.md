# Description

Magic8Ball is a small private project which allows asking a question and receiving a random answer.

# Usage

Open the webpage, enter a question into the input box and click "Ask!". A random answer will be displayed in the triangle below the Ask! button.

If no question is asked, on clicking the Ask! button, a thick red border will appear around the input box, drawing attention to the placement text which states "Type your question". The question itself does not have to end with a ?, but rather the code checks that anything has been entered into the input box before allowing the Ask! button to pull a random answer from an array.

# Interesting Tidbit

Rats succumb to peer-pressure, just like humans. Brown rats are prone to disregard personal experiences in order to copy the behavior of their peers. For example, they will eat unpalatable food if they are in the company of other rats who are eating it.
