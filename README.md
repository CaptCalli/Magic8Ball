# Magic8Ball 

Magic8Ball is a project emulating a Magic 8 Ball experience. 

# Description

Magic8Ball is a small private project which allows asking a question and receiving a random answer. 
[Magic8Ball Site](https://kernscode.github.io/Magic8Ball/)

# Usage

Open the webpage, enter a question into the input box and click "Ask!". A random answer will be displayed in the triangle below the Ask! button.

If no question is answered, upon clicking the Ask! button, a thick red border will appear around the input box, drawing attention to the placement text which states "Type your question". The question itself does not have to end with a ?, but rather the code checks that anything has been entered into the input box before allowing the Ask! button to pull a random answer from an array.
